## Crushing Concrete Cube or Cylinder at 28 days
Apr 01,2018 · The crushing of concrete cubes or cylinder samples is required in a construction especially concrete structures.The reason why this is to verify the strength given in the design mix.Let say for example for a concrete column commonly it has 60 megapascals of specified strength.When you crush it,the result should be equal or more than 60 Mpa.The specified strength should be achieved at.American Concrete InstituteThe American Concrete Institute (ACI) is a leading authority and resource worldwide for the development and distribution of consensus based standards,technical resources,educational programs,certification programs,and proven expertise for individuals and organizations involved in concrete design,construction,and materials,who share a commitment to pursuing the best use of concrete.
