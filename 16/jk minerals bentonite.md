## Microstructure and micro macro.
Major properties of bentonite are induced by the relationship of montmorillonite and interlayer water.Here,we consider a clay water system with a mineral (i.e.beidellite) and a large number of water.Then we calculate local properties for sliced small domains of water with a thickness of 0.25 nm parallel to the mineral surface.Spatial Distribution of Minerals in Jammu and KashmirBentonite: Bentonite is especial assemblage of clay mineral,in many instances formed by weathering of acid,lavas and pyroclastic rocks.The deposits of bentonite are spread between Bhimber and Kathua in the Jammu Division.These de­posits lie,on the gentle dipping slopes of the outer plains of Jammu.
