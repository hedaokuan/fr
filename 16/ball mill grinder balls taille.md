## Calculate and Select Ball Mill Ball Size for Optimum Grinding
In Grinding,selecting (calculate) the correct or optimum ball size that allows for the best and optimum ideal or target grind size to be achieved by your ball mill is an important thing for a Mineral Processing Engineer AKA Metallurgist to do.Often,the ball used in ball mills is oversize "just in case".Well,this safety factor can cost you much in recovery and or mill liner wear and tear.How I built a quick and easy home made ball millI have been powering the ball mill with my bench variable power supply so I could fine tune the rotation speed.I wanted it to turn as fast as possible to speed grinding,but not so fast that centrifugal force pins the balls to the wall of the drum preventing them from tumbling over each other.
