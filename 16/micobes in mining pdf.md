## THE IMPORTANCE OF DILUTION FACTOR FOR OPEN PIT.
THE IMPORTANCE OF DILUTION FACTOR FOR OPEN PIT MINING PROJECTS* Anoush Ebrahimi,P.Eng.Ph.D.Principal Consultant at SRK Consulting 22nd Floor,1066 West Hastings Street,Understanding Soil Microbes and Nutrient Recycling OhiolineSoil microorganisms exist in large numbers in the soil as long as there is a carbon source for energy.A large number of bacteria in the soil exists,but because of their small size,they have a smaller biomass.Actinomycetes are a factor of 10 times smaller in number but are larger in size so they are similar in biomass to bacteria.Fungus population numbers are smaller but they dominate the.

## Bioleaching Application of Biotechnology in Mining Industry
Bioleaching is a part of microbial mining.In microbial leaching or bioleaching metals can be extracted from large quantities of low grade ores This process has been used for centuries to recover copper form the drainage water of mines the role of microbes in the bioleaching came into notice some 40 years ago.Mechanisms Involved in BioleachingMining With Microbes October 15,2012 Issue Vol.90.That's why researchers have become increasingly keen to get these microbes on the mining payroll.They're looking for ways to use bacteria and archaea to extract metal from virgin rock as well.
