CalPortland awards FLSmidth an EPC contract for their Mojave Raw Mill Project.Glendora,CA May 26,2020 In an agreement signed earlier this month,CalPortland ® has awarded a supply contract to FLSmidth for their Mojave Raw Mill Project.The scope of supply includes engineering,equipment and installation of a new OK ® 48 4 Raw Mill with Condition Monitoring System,and an ECS.End mill helix angle selection Blogs CNCTimes.comEnd mill helix angles how do they matter? The cutting force on an end mill has a radial and an axial component.The radial component tends to bend the end mill and results in vibrations,while the axial component presses the end mill against the holder.The higher the helix angle,the greater the proportion of axial force.
