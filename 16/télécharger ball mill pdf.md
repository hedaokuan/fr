## Ball Mills: Steel Ball Mills and Lined Ball Mills Orbis.
Ball Mill Design & Manufacturing.Our combined experience in ball mill design and process equipment development totals more than 60 years and allows us to put a unique spin on steel and lined mills.Particle size reduction of materials in a ball mill with the presence of metallic balls or other media dates back to the late 1800's.Autogenous and Semi Autogenous Mills MetsoAG SAG mills can accomplish the same size reduction work as two or three stages of crushing and screening,a rod mill,and some or all of the work of a ball mill.Because of the range of mill sizes available,AG SAG milling can often be accomplished with fewer lines than in a conventional rod mill ball circuit.All of the above contributes to

## Stirred Milling VERTIMILL® Grinding Mills & Stirred Media.
Stirred Mills have been proven to provide energy savings compared with traditional ball mills.The finer the product required,the more efficient stirred mills will be than a ball mill.The attrition grinding action,vertical arrangement,and the finer media size distribution contribute to make stirred mills more energy efficient grinding machines.TECHNICAL AND COMMERCIAL BENEFITS OF GEARLESS.general,the bigger the mill diameter,the lower are the mill operating and critical speeds.Thus,for larger mills the number of poles will increase.As a result,the number of poles can vary from 48 to 72 poles (Fig.3.) with typical mill speed requirements of about 10 rpm for larger SAG mills and about 15 rpm for smaller ball mills.Figure 3.

## High energy ball milling process for nanomaterial synthesis
Synthesis of Nanomaterials by High Energy Ball Milling W.Cao.It is a ball milling process where a powder mixture placed in the ball mill is subjected to high energy collision from the balls.This process was developed by Benjamin and his coworkers at the International Nickel Company in the late of 1960.Ball mill WikipediaA ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.
