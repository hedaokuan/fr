Typically the kiln is driven at speeds of 0.5 to 2 RPM,often with variable speed arrangements.Typical transit times for the lime through the kiln are from 1.5 hours to 4 hours under normal operating conditions.This is set by the speed and by the slope of the kiln,which is.Grate kiln systems MetsoThe process system is designed so that material transfer from the grate to the kiln occurs when the material on the grate is sufficiently preheated to have the requisite indurate strength for subsequent processing in the rotary kiln.A rotary kiln is a steel round shell with refractory lining that rotates.
