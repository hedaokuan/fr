## Selectively leaching the iron removed bauxite residues.
Bauxite residue (BR) is a hazardous industrial waste and also becomes an important reserve of rare earth elements (REE).An elegant process for achieving separation of REEs against silica from an iron removed BR was established in this paper through selective leaching of silica with simultaneous enrichment of REEs.Smelting of Bauxite Residue (Red Mud) in. SpringerLinkThe chemical analysis of the bauxite residue used in this study is shown in Tables 1 and 2.Table 1 shows that the bauxite residue is rich in iron oxide and alumina.Table 2 shows that the total REE content in the bauxite residue is about 0.1 %.It also shows the total REE content of the slag generated after smelting experiments for the sake of comparison.
