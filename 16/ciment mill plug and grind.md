## Rawmill Wikipedia
A raw mill is the equipment used to grind raw materials into "rawmix" during the manufacture of cement.Rawmix is then fed to a cement kiln,which transforms it into clinker,which is then ground to make cement in the cement mill.The raw milling stage of the process effectively defines the chemistry (and therefore physical properties) of the finished cement,and has a large effect upon the.OK™ cement mill The most energy efficient mill for cement.Proven commercially,the OK™ mill is the premier roller mill for finish grinding of Portland cement,slag and blended cements.The mill consistently uses five to ten percent less power than other cement vertical roller mills,and in comparison with traditional ball mill operations,the energy requirements for the OK cement mill is
