## Baryte Wikipedia
Baryte or barite (UK: ˈ b ær ʌ ɪ t , ˈ b ɛər aɪ t [citation needed]) is a mineral consisting of barium sulfate (Ba S O 4).Baryte is generally white or colorless,and is the main source of barium.The baryte group consists of baryte,celestine (strontium sulfate),anglesite (lead sulfate),and.2015 Minerals Yearbookis its specific gravity (SG) and,until 2010,the API specification called for a minimum SG of 4.2.because of concerns about dwindling reserves of 4.2 SG barite,the aPi issued a new edition of API Specification 13A,Specification for Drilling Fluids Materials,adding specifications for 4.1 SG barite.

## Joyal Three ring Micro Powder Mill,Three ring Micro Powder.
Three ring Micro Powder Mill Grinding.The JOYAL Three ring Micro Powder Mill(ultrafine mill) is for super fine grinding materials with hardness less than 6 in Moh's scale and humidity less than 6 percent such as kaolin,limestone,calcite,marble,talcum,barite,gypsum,dolomite,bentonite mud,mica,pyrophyllite,sepiolite,diatomite,graphite,alunite,fluorite,potassium feldspar.EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES OF ILMENITE AS A WEIGHTING.major disadvantages of barite is sag (the tendency to settle upon aging) and high rheology (plastic viscosity) particularly in high density drilling fluids (Aldea et al.2001; Meeten 2001).Another disadvantage is the low hardness (2.5 3.5),which can,on prolonged shearing,lead to the creation of fine colloidal particles that contribute to
