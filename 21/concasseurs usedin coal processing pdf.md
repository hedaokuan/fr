Historical background.Coal liquefaction originally was developed at the beginning of the 20th century.The best known CTL process is Fischer Tropsch synthesis (FT),named after the inventors Franz Fischer and Hans Tropsch from the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in the 1920s.The FT synthesis is the basis for indirect coal liquefaction (ICL) technology.Coal gasification WikipediaCoal gasification is the process of producing syngas a mixture consisting primarily of carbon monoxide (CO),hydrogen (H 2),carbon dioxide (CO 2),natural gas (CH 4),and water vapour (H 2 O) from coal and water,air and or oxygen.Historically,coal was gasified to produce coal gas,also known as "town gas".Coal gas is combustible and was used for municipal lighting,and heating.
