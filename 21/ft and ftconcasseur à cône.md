## Cone Volume Calculator
A truncated cone is the cone with the top cut off,with a cut perpendicular to the height.You can calculate frustum volume by subtracting smaller cone volume (the cut one) from the bigger base one,or use the formula: volume = (1 3) * π * depth * (r² + r * R + R²),where R is a radius of the base of a cone,and r of top surface radius5 Best E Collars for Dogs: Helping With Healing (2019 Reviews)Jun 05,2019 · The cone is reversible,and it features Velcro closures to ensure a snug fit,but you'll need to thread your dog's collar through several loops on the cone to keep it in place.Thin plastic pieces can be inserted or removed from the cone as desired,to alter the rigidity.
