## Climate change's impact on soil moisture could push land.
For the study,the researchers used data from four global climate models to explore how soil moisture changes could impact "net biome productivity" a measure of the carbon gained by the land surface,minus any losses.The models use a future scenario of high greenhouse gas emissions known as "RCP8.5".The research shows that,in many parts of the world,soils could become drier as.
