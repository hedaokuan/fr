to diameter.The vessel is charged with the grinding media.The grinding media may be made of hardened steel,or tungsten carbide,ceramics like agate,porcelain,alumina,zirconia.During rolling of vessel,the grinding media & powder particles roll from some height.This process grinds the powder materials by impact collision & attrition.METAMORPHIC ROCKS & PROCESSES Lakehead UniversityMetamorphic rocks and processes • Metamorphism comes from the Greek words "Meta" change "Morphe" form • Metamorphic rocks form by solid state (no melting) transformation of preexisting rock by processes that take place beneath Earth's surface.

## Dental materials lecture #5 notes
Dental materials' lecture #5 notes Done by: Yaman Tahaineh Corrected by : Baraa Abu Hussein Today's lecture will be about Gypsum (نيصبجلا) {CaSO4.2H2O),it's a mineral widely found in nature,it has been used for dental casts since 1756.•Gypsum products used in dentistry are based on calcium sulfate hemihydrate (CaSO4·1 2H2O).Leaching & Adsorption Resource BookThe gold must be in a fine particulate form (from the grinding circuit).The feed slurry must have an 80% passing size of 75um to achieve suitable gold recovery (refer to cyclone and grinding modules).If the particles are too large they may not be totally leached during their residence time in the tanks and hence will report to tailings.
