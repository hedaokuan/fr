## Cone Crusher VS VSI or Vertical Shaft Impactor
Cone crusher is one of the types of crushing machines.Compared with the cone crusher,the VSI vertical shaft impactor,as another type of cone crusher,does the same job crusher large stones into small pieces.But there are still some differences between them.Impact vs cone crushers: Which is more effective? QuarryThe smaller the output size,the more competitive impact crushers become because their percentage of finished product in the first pass is considerably higher than cone crushers.Combined with an upgrade to wear parts materials,this can allow impact crushers to reach a lower wear cost ratio (per tonne) than cone crushers (see Table 1).
