## Sand Silica Beneficiation 2017 European Masters
Silica Sand Processing Sand Washing Plant Equipment.A Flowsheet for Beneficiation of Silica Sand.The flowsheet illustrated is typical for production of glass sand by flotation.Generally large tonnages are treated,for example,30 to 60 tons per hour.Most sand deposits can be handled by means of a dredge and the sand pumped to the treatment.Silica Glass Sand ArrMazFor industrial applications,deposits of silica yielding products of at least 95% quartz (SiO 2) are preferred.The production of such high purity sand requires that the extracted ore undergo significant processing to reduce impurities through the flotation of gangue minerals such as iron,aluminum and magnesium away from the silica.
