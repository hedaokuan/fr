AnswersDriveThe results showed that porosity increases with decreasing grain size.Theoretically,grain size does not affect porosity for well sorted grains but in nature,sand grain size affects porosity probably because sand grain deformation from a spherical shape increases with decrease in particle size.

## Grain size distributions of chalk from image analysis of.
In the chalk of the Ekofisk formation in the Chalk Group of the North Sea,substantial depth related variations in porosity are observed.With the aim of obtaining a textural interpretation of these porosity data,we have developed a method to assess the grain size distribution of the chalk.KGS Fort Hays Chalk UtilizationChalk grains studied by us range from 0.2 to 0.55 microns.Precipitated whiting made from this chalk would have a smaller grain size.Abrasion and rapid wear of the internal structure of rubber particles.
