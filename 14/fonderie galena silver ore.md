## Lead Smelting Base Metal Smelting
1) The galena is roasted (reacts with O2) in order to remove the sulfur component of the metal sulfide [2].Roasting is a method where a sulfide ore (i.e an ore containing PbS) is heated in air which converts the metal sulfide to either a metal oxide or a metal itself [3].ACANTHITE ARGENTITE (Silver Sulfide)Acanthite is the most important silver ore next to galena.Actually there is an argument to be made that acanthite could be the most important silver ore.Galena is a lead ore that often contains enough silver (usually about 1%) that when it is processed for its lead content the by product silver supplies the majority of the world's needs.But most,if not all the silver in argentiferous galena.

The total production of lead and silver from the Pequea mines is difficult to estimate.No production records exist for either the pre­ Colonial or Colonial activities.Two tons of galena bearing ore (per­ haps contianing 5% galena) were mentioned in 1853 and in 1863 the Lancaster Lead Company claimed production of about 10 tons ofSilver ores Danafloat HomeThe most common silver bearing minerals recovered by flotation are argentiferous galena,native silver,argentite (Ag2S) and tetrahedrite (Cu,Fe,Ag) Sb4S3).Often these minerals float with the base metals such as copper and lead sulphides or are the primary target mineral (tetrahedrite).

## Galena Hopewell Culture National Historical Park (U.S.
Galena ore contains silver and is a major source for the world's silver.Although the typical amount of silver contained in galena is significantly less than the amount of lead,the value of the silver far exceeds that of lead (over 300 times more valuable than lead).Lead's primary use in today's culture is in lead acid batteries which are.Smelting high grade lead silver ore [Archive.I live in Silver City,New Mexico and have discovered some nearby sources of high grade argentiferous galena.I've been playing with different flux recipes.(none very successful).The first reduction attempts were with pulverized & washed ore + flux (only powdered charcoal & a dash of borax) with a bernzomatic propane torch & an iron skillet.
