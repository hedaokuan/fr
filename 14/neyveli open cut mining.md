## Environmental Risks of Mining
Open pit mining.Open pit mining,where material is excavated from an open pit,is one of the most common forms of mining for strategic minerals.This type of mining is particularly damaging to the environment because strategic minerals are often only available in small concentrations,which increases the amount of ore needed to be mined.NSW Mining Methods NSW MiningNSW has both open cut and underground mines.Open cut mining.Open cut mining usually happens where mineral deposits are close to the surface.It involves blasting and removing surface layers of soil and rock to reach the mineral deposit.When the mineral seam becomes exposed,it is drilled,fractured and the mineral recovered for processing.
