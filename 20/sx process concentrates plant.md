## Solvent extraction and electrowinning Wikipedia
Solvent extraction and electrowinning (SX EW) is a two stage hydrometallurgical process that first extracts and upgrades copper ions from low grade leach solutions into a solvent containing a chemical that selectively reacts with and binds the copper in the solvent.The copper is extracted from the solvent with strong aqueous acid which then deposits pure copper onto cathodes using an.SX EW growthto recover the copper and second to zinc SX and EW to recover the zinc after removal of some impurities such as iron,silica,etc.The acidic raffinate solution leaving SX is recycled to the leaching operations.A series of process flowsheet were designed and developed,and a comparative analysis was performed to choose the best process.
