Attritors,wet grind Attritors,regular speed Attritors,and high speed Attritors.A useful and simple equation describing the grinding momentum is M x V (mass x velocity),which enables us to see how the Attritor fits into the family of mills.For example,ball mills use large media,normally 1 2" or larger,and run at a low (10 50) rpm.Wet Grinding VS Dry Ball Mill GrindingBatch Ball Mill Grinding.Capacities and efficiencies in wet and dry ball milling at different speeds and ore charges have been discussed in the foregoing pages.The results are summarized in table 16,which shows that in both capacity and efficiency grinding was at its best with small ore charges and high speed.

## Wet Milling Process Custom Milling & Consulting
Wet milling,also called wet media milling,is a process in which particles are dispersed in a liquid by shearing,by impact or crushing,or by attrition.A mill is charged with media (small beads or spheres).Mechanical alloying WikipediaMechanical alloying (MA) is a solid state and powder processing technique involving repeated cold welding,fracturing,and re welding of blended powder particles in a high energy ball mill to produce a homogeneous material.Originally developed to produce oxide dispersion strengthened (ODS) nickel and iron base superalloys for applications in the aerospace industry,MA has now been shown to.
