Typically,a SAG mill based circuit (P80 of 106 to 150 um) has media costs of around A$1 t.Providing the ore is amenable,the use of primary autogenous milling can reduce this cost by 40%.Autogenous milling is typically practiced in associatioDesign of the 40 foot SAG Mill Installed at the Cadia Gold.The design of the 40 foot diameter SAG mill installed at the Cadia Gold Mine,New South Wales Australia,followed after two years of extensive.SAG Mill Dimensions: The SAG mill was designed

## How can one select ball size in ball milling and how much.
More balls with small size results in fine powder.As a thumb rule powder to be milled should be taken as 25% of total ball weight.If the quantity of charge is very less then milling balls will.SAG Mill Liner Design Mineral Processing & MetallurgyTo a more significant degree than in other comminution devices,SAG Mill Liner Design and Configuration can have a substantial effect mill performance.In general terms,lifter spacing and angle,grate open area and aperture size,and pulp lifter design and capacity must be considered.
