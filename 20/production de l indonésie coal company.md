## Coal and Air Pollution Union of Concerned Scientists
CO 2 is also the main byproduct of coal combustion: nearly 4 grams of CO2 are produced for every gram of carbon burnt (depending on its type,coal can contain as much as 60 to 80 percent carbon).Methane (CH4) often occurs in the same areas that coal is formed,and is released during mining activities.Top four U.S.coal companies supplied more than half of U.In the past two years,more than half of U.S.coal production was attributable to the top four coal producers,the result of changes in regional production as well as decades long trends towards the concentration of coal production around the top few companies.
