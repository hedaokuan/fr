## Quarry mining Britannica
Quarry,place where dimension stone or aggregate (sand,gravel,crushed rock) is mined.The products of dimension stone quarries are prismatic blocks of rock such as marble,granite,limestone,sandstone,and slate.After cutting and polishing,these materials are used in the primary constructionChapter 5 Engineering Properties of Soil and RockChapter 5 Engineering Properties of Soil and Rock 5.1 Overview The purpose of this chapter is to identify,either by reference or explicitly herein,appropriate methods of soil and rock property assessment,and how to use that soil and rock property data to establish the final soil and rock parameters to be used for geotechnical design.
