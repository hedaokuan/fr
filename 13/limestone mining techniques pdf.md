American.There are four main mining methods: underground,open surface (pit),placer,and in situ mining.Underground mines are more expensive and are often used to reach deeper deposits.Surface mines are typically used for more shallow and less valuable deposits.Placer mining is used to sift out valuable metals from sediments in river channels,beach sands,or other environments.

## Environmental Hazards of Limestone Mining Sciencing
However,underground limestone mines can be found in the central and eastern United States,especially near cities.In humid climates,limestone dissolves quickly and is carried away by water.This creates caves which can become weak and collapse.Underground mining of limestone can cause a cascading environmental impact.OF MISSOURI(MLPA) reports that limestone is mined in 92 of Missouri's 114 counties and the industry employs more than 2,500 people.In 2004,the production of limestone commodities was valued at nearly one billion dollars,accounting for over 60% of Missouri's produced mineral value.All this resulted from an estimated 75 million tons of mined limestone.
