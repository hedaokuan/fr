## Comparison between Rod Mill and Ball Mill ore processing
Rod mill is a type of grinding mill whose grinding media is steel bar,while ball mill is steel ball.1.Rod mill are usually applied to grinding the w sn ore and rare metal in the reselection or magneticore dressing plant in order to avoid the damage caused by the over crushing.2.In the two stage grinding process,if it requires grinding the ore from 20 6mm to 1 3mm in the first stage,rod.USING THE SMC TEST® TO PREDICT COMMINUTION.work index covering grinding of fine particles is labelled M ib (Morrell,2008).M ia values are provided as a standard output from a SMC Test® (Morrell,2004a) whilst M ib values can be determined using the data generated by a conventional Bond ball mill work index test (M ib is NOT the Bond ball work index).M ic and M ih values are also.
