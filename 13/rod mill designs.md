## Rod mills,how they function Mine Engineer.Com
Rod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.Difference Between Sag Mill vs Ball Mill mech4studyOct 12,2017 · Today we will learn about difference between sag mill vs ball mill.A mill is a machine by which solid or hard materials are broken into smaller pieces by means of grinding,crushing or cutting.This commutation is an essential part of many processes.Various kinds of mills are there with which different material processing takes place.
