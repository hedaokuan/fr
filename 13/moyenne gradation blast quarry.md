## Measurement of Size Distribution of Blasted Rock Using.
Abstract.The purpose of this study is to measure the size distribution of blasted rock using the digital image processing software "Split Desktop system" in order to evaluate the efficiency of blasting operation.Site of study is a limestone quarry producing limestone for cement manufacturing.Fragmentation is the ultimate measure of.Quarrying Process And Quarry ProductsThe process begins with a detailed three dimensional survey of the quarry face.This allows the explosives engineer to design the blast and to plot where the shot holes should be drilled so that the blast can be carried out safely and efficiently.The survey will show if.

## Oregon Department of Transportation : Material Sources.
The process of excavating rock from material sources often requires blasting in the quarry.The potential damage from ground vibration,air blast and flying debris is a major consideration when planning excavation activities.ODOT and its contractors make every effort to minimize potential impacts on neighboring properties from this type of work.5 Aggregate ProductionHole detonation sequencing and blast intensity also are required to be properly engineered.Size changes resulting from inattention to detail can have the same effects as mentioned above.Also,an erratic blast that throws the shot rock over a large area tends to cause variation in size gradation that is delivered to the primary crusher.
