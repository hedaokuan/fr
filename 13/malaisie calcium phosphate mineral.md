## Calcium and Phosphate Homeostasis
Bone calcium: A vast majority of body calcium is in bone.Within bone,99% of the calcium is tied up in the mineral phase,but the remaining 1% is in a pool that can rapidly exchange with extracellular calcium.As with calcium,the majority of body phosphate (approximately 85%) is present in the mineral.Minerals: Calcium,Phosphorus,and Magnesium.Three minerals—calcium,phosphorus,and magnesium—account for 98% of the body's mineral content by weight.Calcium and phosphorus play basic roles in countless biochemical reactions at the cellular level.They are also the main components of the skeleton,and without magnesium many metabolic.
