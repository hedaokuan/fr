## System of Energy Saving Optimal Control of Metal Heating.
Figure1presents the production diagram.CCM cast blanks go to the warehouse.Some of them,if possible,go to the heat treatment furnace to equalize the temperatures within the cross section and to heat them to the level required for rolling.Storage is necessary to bring the CCM production rates in line with those of the rolling mill.Hot & Cold Working and the Rolling ProcessEndless Hot Strip Rolling Process.In conventional hot strip production,slabs of thickness of about 250mm are heated in a furnace and are reduced to 30 to 60mm in thickness after passing through the roughing mill,and then further reducing it to within a range of 0.8 to 25.4mm by rolling in the finishing mill.
