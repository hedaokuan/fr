## VIBRA DRUM® Grinding Mill & Crushing Mill General Kinematics
General Kinematics VIBRA DRUM® Grinding Mills are proven in dozens of milling applications in the mining and mineral industries.Each grinding mill is achieving impressive energy savings (35 50%),thanks to a unique rotational material motion that is more efficient than conventional ball or rotary grinding mills.New processes such as micron grinding and mechanochemical grinding give our.AMIT 135: Lesson 7 Ball Mills & Circuits Mining Mill.Mill Type Overview.Three types of mill design are common.The Overflow Discharge mill is best suited for fine grinding to 75 106 microns.; The Diaphram or Grate Discharge mill keeps coarse particles within the mill for additional grinding and typically used for grinds to 150 250 microns.; The Center Periphery Discharge mill has feed reporting from both ends and the product discharges.
