## Barite Metaphysical Healing Properties
Barite is the main source of barium.Barite is thought to have been extensively used by the Native Americans in their religious practices.Apparently,the Natives used it to shape shift as well as to go from the physical world to the spiritual.Barite takes a wide variety of forms and occurs as blade,prismatic and often large tabular crystals.Kempfi eld Silver,Barite and Base.Barite appears to be hosted in greatest concentrations by the coarser grained volcanoclastic sandstones and grits,whilst intercalated siltstones are volumetrically minor and tend to return low barite and silver.Mineralisation is hosted in stratiform and probably stratabound barite rich horizons.A northeast
