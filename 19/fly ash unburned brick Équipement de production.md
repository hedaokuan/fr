Background and Objective: Coal fly ash generated from the combustion of coal by thermal power plant stations are enormous and the disposal there of is a big problem.In the present study,the chemical,mineralogical and morphological characterization of coal fly ash samples (CFAs) obtained from Mpumalanga province,South Africa were investigated.Advanced utilisation options for biomass gasification fly ash• Existing (combustion) options for utilisation of fly ash are not valid for the ash derived from the FBG of orujillo (pretreatment is needed) • Demonstration that fly ash from FBG of orujillo has potential as the main constituent in lightweight wallboards (60% ash) and bricks (20% ash) • Optimisation of the blend composition for the

## Ash Management Review—Applications of Biomass Bottom Ash
In addition,high levels of unburned carbon can be found in the ash produced from boilers.According to Demirbas [8],the fly ash from biomass fired grate boilers contain high levels of unburnt carbon and is not suitable for recycling to the forest.Grate boilers often produce a fly ash.(PDF) A Brief Overview of Fly Ash Brick ProductionThe use of fly ash in construction materials and concrete production is relatively low in Turkey when compared to that of Germany,the Netherlands,United Kingdom,United States and China [8,10,18].
