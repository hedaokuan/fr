## Gold mining Wikipedia
Bronze Age gold objects are plentiful,especially in Ireland and Spain,and there are several well known possible sources.Romans used hydraulic mining methods,such as hushing and ground sluicing on a large scale to extract gold from extensive alluvial (loose sediment) deposits,such as those at Las Medulas.Mining was under the control of the state but the mines may have been leased to.The Metallurgy of Cyanide Gold Leaching An Introduction.Oct 20,2014 · Nature of Gold: The surface of a gold particle will typically be dissolved at a rate of around 0.2 0.5 µm of surface depth per hour in a cyanide leach.For large gold particles and nuggets,this is too slow to be fully dissolved in a typical processing plant.
