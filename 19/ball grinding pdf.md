## Optimization of mill performance by using
grinding media wear rates,throughput,power draw,and product grind size from the circuit.Each of these performance parameters peaks at different filling values.In order to contin uously optimize mill operation,it is vital to obtain regular measurements of the ball load and pulp position.The current way to measure the charge filling degreeENERGY SAVINGS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPARISON USING.In part because of high prices of small grinding media as well as availability,the most widely used size of grinding ball is 25 mm or bigger.As mentionned by various authors (Jankovic,Valery and La Rosa,2003; Gao and Holmes,2007),conventional ball milling was discarded because of its very poor energy ef ﬁ ciency caused by those larger.

## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill,a type of grinder,is a cylindrical device used in grinding (or mixing) materials like ores,chemicals,ceramic raw materials and paints.Ball mills rotate around a horizontal axis,partially filled with the material to be ground plus the grinding medium.Different materials are used as media,including ceramic balls,flint pebbles and stainless steel balls.MODULE #5: FUNCTIONAL PERFOMANCE OF BALL MILLING• Ball mill specific grinding rate • Ball mill grinding efficiency The circuit output is defined as the production rate of fines by the circuit.It is calculated from three values: 1.The dry ore feed rate to the circuit (t h).2.The % fines in the circuit feed.3.The % fines in the circuit product.Use this equation to solve for circuit.
