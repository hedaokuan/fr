## About MP Materials
Mountain Pass's bastnaesite ore is one of the world's highest quality rare earth deposits with a greater than 8% average grade.The mine started production in 1952,and was a dominant source of rare earth minerals in the world into the 1990s.Early Mining and Transportation in Southwestern Colorado.The history of early southwestern Colorado mining,up to the Ute removal in 1881,can be summarized by three basic stages: early gold placer mining near Baker's Park,and in the Tin Cup mining district during the early 1860's; the era of silver mining along the Animas River around Silverton and in the Elk Mountain region of modern Gunnison.
