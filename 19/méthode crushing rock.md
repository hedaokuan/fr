## Experimental Study on Limestone Cohesive Particle Model.
This study investigates the effect of impact velocity and particle size on crushing characteristics.We use a discrete element method simulation and construct cohesive limestone particles with internal microinterfaces and cracks for impact crushing experimentation.The simulation model follows the same process as the impact crushing experiment.Results show that,after crushing at impact.12 LABORATORY SAMPLE PREPARATIONgrinding and crushing (Dean,1995).Decreases in water content are sometimes observed while grinding solids containing essential water in the form of hydrates,likely as a result of localized heating.(See Section 12.3.1.2 for a discussion of the types of moisture present in solid samples.)

## ASTM C39 C39M 18 Standard Test Method for Compressive.
5.1 Care must be exercised in the interpretation of the significance of compressive strength determinations by this test method since strength is not a fundamental or intrinsic property of concrete made from given materials.Values obtained will depend on the size and shape of the specimen,batching,mixing procedures,the methods of sampling,molding,and fabrication and the age.different rock crushers as well as rock analysisCrusher Wikipedia.A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.
