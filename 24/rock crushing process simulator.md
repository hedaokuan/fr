## Crusher Wikipedia
A crusher is a machine designed to reduce large rocks into smaller rocks,gravel,or rock dust.Crushers may be used to reduce the size,or change the form,of waste materials so they can be more easily disposed of or recycled,or to reduce the size of a solid mix of raw materials (as in rock ore),so that pieces of different composition can be differentiated.Computer Simulation Methods for Crushing Process in an Jaw.Computer Simulation Methods for Crushing Process in an Jaw Crusher: Authors:.The maximum size of the rock mass pieces is one of the basic parameters for it.The crushing plants applies as a coarse crushing followed by crushing the material to the maximum size of piece which possible to use for conveyor transport.Modelling of crushing.
