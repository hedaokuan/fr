## Igneous rock Wikipedia
Igneous rock (derived from the Latin word ignis meaning fire),or magmatic rock,is one of the three main rock types,the others being sedimentary and metamorphic.Igneous rock is formed through the cooling and solidification of magma or lava.The magma can be derived from partial melts of existing rocks in either a planet's mantle or crust.Typically,the melting is caused by one or more of.Igneous Rocks: Everything You Need to KnowThe main minerals in igneous rocks are hard,primary ones: feldspar,quartz,amphiboles,and pyroxenes (together called "dark minerals" by geologists),as well as olivine,along with the softer mineral mica.The two best known igneous rock types are basalt and granite,which have distinctly different compositions and textures.
