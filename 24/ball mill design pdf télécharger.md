## Grinding in Ball Mills: Modeling and Process Control
The design of a ball mill can vary significantly depending on the size,the equipment used to load the starting material (feeders),and the system for discharging the output product.The size of a mill is usually characterized by the ratio "length to diameter" and this ratio most frequently varies from 0.5 to 3.5.TheCement Ball Mill Design Pdf fachmonteureBall Mill Design Power Calculation.The basic parameters used in ball mill design (power calculations),rod mill or any tumbling mill sizing are; material to be ground,characteristics,Bond Work Index,bulk density,specific density,desired mill tonnage capacity DTPH,operating % solids or pulp density,feed size as F80 and maximum 'chunk size',product size as P80 and.
