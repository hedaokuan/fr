## Clinker burning in the cement process of the primaries.
It is the stage in which most of the operating costs in cement manufacturing appear and is also where most opportunities for process improvement exist.The main challenges at this stage in the clinker production are preventing blockages in the preheater,measuring the process accurately and maximizing production in this hot and rough environment.Steps of Cement Production Process Flyer Cement SiloSteps of Cement Production Process.Cement is one of the most common and important building materials.It is a very critical ingredient because only cement has the ability to increase the viscosity of concrete,which in turn provides the ability to lock sand and gravel together in concrete mixtures.
