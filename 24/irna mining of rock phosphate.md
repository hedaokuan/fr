A "hard rock" phosphate reserve in North Central Florida was discovered next.Thus began Florida's phosphate mining industry.Florida's phosphate mining today accounts for about 80% of the phosphate used in the United States,as well as about 25% of the phosphate used around the world.Phosphate Beneficiation ProcessLarge scale mining and processing of phosphate is essential for operating at a profit.In the Florida area,Phosphate Beneficiation by flotation unlocked the door to vast tonnages of ore which in the past could not be recovered by conventional washing methods which saved only the coarser pebble phosphate.Many of the areas now being mined contain very little or no pebble phosphate,so the main.

Phosphate deposits can contain significant amounts of naturally occurring heavy metals.Mining operations processing phosphate rock can leave tailings piles containing elevated levels of cadmium,lead,nickel,copper,chromium,and uranium.Unless carefully managed,these waste products can leach heavy metals into groundwater or nearby estuaries.
