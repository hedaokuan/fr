## Effect of Grinding Media Charge on Mill Power Draw kW
Maximum power is drawn by a mill when the charge occupies approximately 50% by volume.The power curve becomes very flat in the range above 45%.As a result,mills are seldom run with charge levels greater than 45%.In rod mills,the charge is swollen by particles of feed which separate the rods.If the mill is shut down immediately after the feed is shut off,the charge level will be greater.284 Mill Rd The Masters Condos 9 Condos for Sale.284 Mill Rd has 9 Condos for Sale.284 Mill Rd is located in Markland Wood,Toronto & has 498 Condos over 15 Storeys.View current & past Sales Leases,Values & trends at The Masters.The Masters's Addresses include 284 300 Mill Rd.

## When to Replace Tie Rods It Still Runs
When to Replace Tie Rods by Jody L.Campbell.On rack and pinion steering,the inner tie rods extend from the steering rack and directly attach to the outer tie rods ends.The outer tie rod ends are connected to the steering knuckle.This assembly maintains the maneuverability of the steering.Tie rods and tie rod ends also are manipulated.Rod mills,how they function Mine Engineer.ComRod mills operate at lower speed than ball mills since the rods are rolled and not cascaded.For an equivalent grind,a rod mill uses less steel than a ball mill because of the lower speed and better contact between the media and ore.The rod charge must be maintained in good working condition,and broken and worn rods must be removed.
