Jun 19,2017 · The various aspects of the production of aluminum are shown including Bauxite Refining (:09),Smelting of Aluminum,and Aluminum Fabricating Process.The Bayer process.Bauxite to aluminium Boyne SmeltersThe refining process is as follows: Bauxite is finely ground in mills,then mixed with a caustic soda solution and steam under pressure at high temperatures,which dissolves the alumina content of the bauxite; The clarification stage separates the bauxite from the alumina and caustic soda solution.

## The Bauxite Index
Bayer.Today the Bayer process dominates the production of alumina as it is the lowest cost production route.The process uses a recirculating volume of concentrated caustic solution to dissolve the alumina minerals,separate them from still solid impurities,and then re precipitate alumina tri hydrate.Primary Production The Aluminum AssociationOnce mined,aluminum within the bauxite ore is chemically extracted into alumina,an aluminum oxide compound,through the Bayer process.In a second step,the alumina is smelted into pure aluminum metal through the Hall Héroult process.The Hall Héroult process: How primary aluminum is made
