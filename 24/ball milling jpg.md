It seems highly likely there is a ball end mill involved in getting the final smooth shape (maybe after roughing out the holes with a cylindrical tool).The main question is whether the ball is the same size as the hole,or a bit smaller (which would require it to move around in little spiral paths instead of just going in and out once).Category:Ball mills Wikimedia CommonsBall mill.jpg 276 × 279；17キロバイト Ballmill.jpg 311 × 233；22キロバイト Centrale Thermique de Bouchain stock de boulet en fer pour pulvérisation du charbon.JPG 1,920 × 1,080；1.05メガバイト
