## The future of nickel: A class act
This shift to class 2 nickel has hurt mining companies producing the higher purity class 1 nickel product as an increasing supply of lower cost class 2 nickel caused nickel prices to plummet from approximately USD 29,000 per metric ton in 2011 to just above USD 10,000 in 2017.Bill to ban copper nickel mining draws sharp contrast.The copper and nickel deposits that lie underneath the lakes and forests of northeastern Minnesota are encased in sulfide ore.When that ore is exposed in the mining process,it produces sulfuric.
