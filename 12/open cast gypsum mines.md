## Open pit mining Wikipedia
Open pit,open cast or open cut mining is a surface mining technique of extracting rock or minerals from the earth by their removal from an open pit or borrow.This form of mining differs from extractive methods that require tunnelling into the earth,such as long wall mining.Open pit mines are used when deposits of commercially useful ore or rocks are found near the surface.
