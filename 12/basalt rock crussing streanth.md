## Compressive strength of rocks PetroWiki
Estimating compressive strength.General rock failure criterion can be reduced to a few parameters dependent on lithology (m) and the uniaxial compressive strength (C 0).Lithology is commonly derived during log analysis,so m may be estimated (Table 1).What is needed still is an initial measure of rock strength provided by C 0.C 0 can be estimated from porosity or sonic velocities,but many.
