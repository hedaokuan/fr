## Crushers and Their Types IspatGuru
Apr 03,2015 · Crushers are also classified by their method of mechanically transmitted fracturing energy to the material.Jaw,gyratory and roll crushers work by applying compressive forces while impact crushers such as hammer crusher apply high speed impact force to accomplish fracturing.There are several types of crushers which are used in various industries.Cone Crusher an overview ScienceDirect TopicsA smooth surfaced roll crusher had a roll diameter of 910 mm.Its suitability to crush an ore at 10.0 t h was being examined.Preliminary examination showed that the kinetic friction factor was 0.36 when the speed of revolution was 33 rpm.The average diameter of particles fed to the crusher was 200 mm and the S.G.of the ore was 2.8.Estimate: 1.
