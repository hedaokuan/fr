Laterite has commonly been referred to as a soil type as well as being a rock type.This and further variation in the modes of conceptualizing about laterite (e.g.also as a complete weathering profile or theory about weathering) has led to calls for the term to be abandoned altogether.Technology: A roof and four walls from the sub Saharan soilThousands of homeless people in sub Saharan Africa could soon end up with cheap but sturdy roofs over their heads thanks to a project in Britain.The aim of the project,orchestrated by a charity.
