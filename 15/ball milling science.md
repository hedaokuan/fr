## The ball‐milling of cellulose fibers and recrystallization.
The type of lattice which develops on recrystallization was found to depend on the original lattice,the extent of ball‐milling and the conditions of recrystallization.A highly ball‐milled sample could be made to recrystallize as cellulose I,II,or IV depending on the conditions.Milling cutter WikipediaMilling cutters are cutting tools typically used in milling machines or machining centres to perform milling operations (and occasionally in other machine tools).They remove material by their movement within the machine (e.g.a ball nose mill) or directly from the cutter's shape (e.g.a.
