## Cut off grade estimation QueensMineDesignWiki
Cut Off grade is the minimum grade required in order for a mineral or metal to be economically mined (or processed).Material found to be above this grade is considered to be ore,while material below this grade is considered to be waste.Although in a variety of units can be used,the cut off grade.MINING IN A NUTSHELLMining in a nutshell lower grades 3 Science and Technology Grades 1 4 Distributed by Women in Mining Education Foundation Revised 2014 a) This is the RECYCLING RECLAMATION phase.8) Use the poster "FROM THE MINE TO MY HOME" to recap the activity.

## (PDF) Decreasing Metal Ore Grades: Are They Really Being.
A shift to lower grade ores over time can indeed be observed for many minerals; however,this shift has been driven not by depletion of high grade deposits but rather by dilution of ore grades.Lower Recovery Grades Impact Mountain Province's Q2.The miner notes,however,that the production decline is the result of mining lower grade ore tonnes in Q2 2019: Mountain Province implemented a scheduled (and previously announced) shift in the source of ore feed to the Hearne and SWC Kimberlites,which yields lower grades.
