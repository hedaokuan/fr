## What is a Cone Crusher? (with picture)
The crushing takes place between the central shaft and a crushing plate,known as the mantle.The cone crusher is powered by either electrical or diesel engines that turn a belt drive turbine.These are very powerful motors,because a great deal of force is needed to crush rocks.US6520438B2 Gyratory crusher mainshaft Google PatentsA gyratory crusher uses a new head nut attachment apparatus.The gyratory crusher has a shell,a shaft disposed within the shell,a mantle covering a portion of the shaft,a head nut located above the mantle,and a sleeve between the head nut and the shaft.The sleeve is maintained in position on the shaft by means of a tapered contact surface between the sleeve and the shaft,and the head nut.

## Crusher Bearings: Knowing the basics leads to better care
Mar 03,2016 · In a standard cone crusher,the main shaft is housed in a frame attached to a mantle.A pinion (counter) shaft assembly drives a bevel gear that rotates the cone.As material presses against the bowl liner by the mantle or cone,it is crushed into smaller pieces that fall through to the bottom.Crushers MetsoCone crushers have an oscillating shaft,and the material is crushed in a crushing cavity,between an external fixed element (bowl liner) and an internal moving element (mantle) mounted on the oscillating shaft assembly.An eccentric shaft rotated by a gear and pinion produces the oscillating movement of the main shaft.
