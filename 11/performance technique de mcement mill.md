## Thermal Performance Assessment of Recycled Paper Mill.
Three model houses were designed and developed as per the standards one with recycled paper mill waste (RPMW) cement bricks,another with fly ash bricks and the third with ferrocement wall panels.In order to assess the indoor temperature for these particular sustainable building materials,the temperature inside the model houses was monitored.Mortar Mixing Tips and AmountsMortar mix is a critical important building component that must be combined thoroughly.Mortar is the bonding material between bricks,concrete block,stone,and many other masonry materials.It is made from Portland cement,lime,sand,and water in varying ratios.Each of the standard mortar mixes—Types N,M,S,and O—has different performance characteristics for different building.
