## The Environmental Science of Surface Mining dummies
Strip mining.Strip mining,as the name describes,is a process of removing rock and soil in strips to get to the valuable mineral ores below.After miners extract the resources,they put back the leftover rock and soil,called mining spoils or tailings,to fill in the hole.One way to replace tailings is to simply dump them; luckily,U.S.regulations require mining companies to replace.
