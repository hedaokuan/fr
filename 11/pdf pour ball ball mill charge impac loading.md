## Ball mill Wikipedia
A ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as the balls drop from near the top of the shell.A ball mill consists of a hollow cylindrical shell rotatiSize reduction with Planetary Ball Millsas the impact energy produced by the ball charge is large enough to form an alloy.However,greater en ergy is required for hard brittle ma terials such as covalently bound semiconductors.Mechanical alloying with retSCH Planetary Ball Mills The PM 400 MA with an increased speed ratio of 1: 2.5 or 1: 3.0 is available for such applications.
