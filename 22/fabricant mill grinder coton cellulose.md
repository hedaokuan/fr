## Pulp Bleaching Technology Princeton University
paper mill used chlorine for bleaching was in 1804.Rapid developments in bleaching technology occurred between 1900 and 1930.Multistage bleach ing using calcium hypochlorite followed by an alkaline extraction stage,then a repeat of the hypochlorite bleach stage was first adopted by the industry.Later,technologies that allowed the use ofCellulose polymorphs and physical properties of cotton.When the cotton fabric was treated with the partial mercerization process first and then the liquid ammonia process,both cellulose II and cellulose III were produced and identified with SFG.But XRD and IR failed to detect the presence of cellulose II in the mercerized and ammonia treated fabric.
