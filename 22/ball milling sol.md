## Self Propagating Reactions Induced by Mechanical Alloying.
Introduction.Mechanical alloying is a "brute force" method of affecting alloying and chemical reactions.The mixture of reactant powders and several balls are placed in the milling jar of a high energy ball mill,for example,a shaker mill or a planetary mill (Figure 1).The collisions and friction between the balls,and between the balls and the wall of the container,result in.Low temperature synthesis of cubic phase Li7La3Zr2O12 via.The combination of sol gel synthesis and high energy ball milling is used to investigate the phase transition from tetragonal Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 to cubic Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 without subsequent high temperature calcination,typically above 1200 °C.In this report,tetragonal Li 7 La 3 Zr 2 O 12 powders obtained by sol gel method and low temperature thermal treatments were treated in ethanol.

## Sol (colloid) Wikipedia
A sol is a colloid made out of very small solid particles in a continuous liquid medium.Sols are quite stable and show the Tyndall effect.Examples include blood,pigmented ink,cell fluids,paint,Milk of Magnesia and mud.Artificial sols may be prepared by dispersion or condensation.Dispersion techniques include grinding solids to colloidal dimensions by ball milling and Bredig's arc method.Ball mill WikipediaA ball mill is a type of grinder used to grind,blend and sometimes for mixing of materials for use in mineral dressing processes,paints,pyrotechnics,ceramics and selective laser sintering.It works on the principle of impact and attrition: size reduction is done by impact as.
