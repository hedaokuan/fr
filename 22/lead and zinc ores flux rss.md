## How zinc is made material,used,parts,components.
2 Zinc can be produced by a process called froth flotation,which is also used for reduction of copper and lead ores.This process involves grinding the zinc ore to a fine powder,mixing it with water,pine oil,and flotation chemicals,and then agitating the mixture to "float" the zinc to the surface.Lead Essential Chemical IndustryThe process is carried out in a series of tanks.As the lead and zinc minerals are less readily wetted than the gangue,they adhere to the air bubbles which are carried to the surface.The rock particles sink and the lead and zinc ores are skimmed off.Then the lead ore is separated from the zinc ore.
