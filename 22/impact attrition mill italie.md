## Powder metallurgy basics & applications
Milling: During milling,impact,attrition,shear and compression forces are acted upon particles.During impact,striking of one powder particle against another occurs.Attrition refers to the production of wear debris due to the rubbing action between two particles.Shear refers to cutting of particles resulting in fracture.The particles1 Impact of variety type and particle size distribution on.1 Impact of variety type and particle size distribution on starch enzymatic hydrolysis 2 and functional properties of tef flours 3 4 Workineh Abebe ab,Concha.The second mill was a disc attrition mill (Mill 2) which is 102 the type traditionally used in cottage tef grain milling house (Bishoftu.
