## Blast furnace metallurgy Britannica
Blast furnace,a vertical shaft furnace that produces liquid metals by the reaction of a flow of air introduced under pressure into the bottom of the furnace with a mixture of metallic ore,coke,and flux fed into the top.Blast furnaces are used to produce pig iron from iron ore for subsequent processing into steel,and they are also employed in processing lead,copper,and other metals.Iron & Steel FlintriflesmithIron ore,flux (limestone or oyster shells) and charcoal were loaded into the top of a furnace usually made in the form of a flat topped stone pyramid.Air blasted into the furnace caused the fire's temperature to approach 2000 degrees,freeing the iron from the oxygen and other minerals in the ore.
