## Cement grinding Vertical roller mills versus ball mills
The grinding process in ball mills and vertical roller mills differ fundamentally.In a ball mill the comminution takes place by impact and attrition.The comminution in the vertical roller mill takes place by exposing a bed of material to a pressure sufficiently high to cause fracture of the individual particles in the bed,although the.Our modern vertical roller mill takes you further FLSmidthThe OK™ Mill is offered in a complete size range,including 3 ,4 and 6 roller mills,and the largest vertical roller mill size available with installed power over 11 500 kilowatts.This ensures the ability to meet all possible capacity requirements in a single vertical roller mill solution.
