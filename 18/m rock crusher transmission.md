## Muncie Identification The H.A.M.B.
Feb 21,2010 · Although some claim that the M23 is a 'rock crusher',it is indicated that this box was assembled in both wide and close ratio components and also with straight cut gears common to the rock crusher (M22) transmission.Looks like you have a second design feb.28th,1968,M20 or M21.Definitely not a rock crusher(no straight cut gears).Magical Muncie Four Speed Hotrod HotlineAn M 22 holds up well.The downside is that it tends to make noise.It will rattle at low rpms and whine at higher rpms.The M22 is called the Rock Crusher."Dump the Rock Crusher," hot rodders say.People think all Muncie four speeds are Rock Crushers,but they're not.
