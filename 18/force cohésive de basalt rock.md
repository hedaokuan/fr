## Rock engineering design of post tensioned anchors for dams.
1.Introduction.Ground or rock anchors (sometimes referred to as anchorages) of a number of types have long been used for a range of purposes in rock engineering and in geotechnical engineering more generally (Hobst and Zajíc,1977,Hanna,1982,Habib,1989,Xanthakos,1991,Littlejohn,1993,Littlejohn,1997).Rock anchors are capable of transmitting an applied tensile load to the rock mass.Cohesion on the Geotechnical Information WebsiteCohesive soils are clay type soils.Cohesion is the force that holds together molecules or like particles within a soil.Cohesion,c,is usually determined in the laboratory from the Direct Shear Test.Unconfined Compressive Strength,S uc,can be determined in the laboratory using the Triaxial Test or the Unconfined Compressive Strength Test.There are also correlations for S uc with shear.

## STRENGTH PROPERTIES OF ROCKS AND ROCK MASSES 1.
In general,compared to intact rock,a rock mass has reduced tensile strength (almost zero),and reduced shear strength especi ally along discontinuity planes.Furthermore,if a rock mass is cut by directional joint sets,the rock mass strength is anisotropic.Rock mass strength is scale dependent and varies with the volume of rock under.Compressive strength of basalt rock Mine Equipments'Compressive strength' is the maximum force that can be applied to a rock.INVESTIGATION OF PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF BASALT.and compressive strength after freezing and freeze loss test.strengths decrease exponentially.show that the rock mass compressive strength of basalt is up to.Technical report on geological and geo.

## Weathering & Clay Minerals Tulane University
Types of Chemical Weathering Reactions.Hydrolysis H + or OH replaces an ion in the mineral.Example: Leaching ions are removed by dissolution into water.In the example above we say that the K + ion was leached.; Oxidation Since free oxygen (O 2) is more common near the Earth's surface,it may react with minerals to change the oxidation state of an ion.Shear strength of discontinuities Rocscience Inc.Shear strength of discontinuities Introduction All rock masses contain discontinuities such as bedding planes,joints,shear zones and faults.At shallow depth,where stresses are low,failure of the intact rock material is minimal and the behaviour of the rock mass is controlled by sliding on the discontinuities.

## Shear strength criteria for rock,rock joints,rockfill.
3.Shear strength of rock joints.Recent drafts of the ISRM suggested methods for testing rock joints,and widely circulated errors on the Internet and in commercial numerical modelling software,caused the writer to spend some time on the topic of shear strength of rock.Dynamic Study on Fracture Problems in Viscoelastic.The viscoelastic deformation behavior of a sedimentary rock under different loading rates is numerically modeled and investigated by the numerical manifold method (NMM).By incorporating a modified 3 element viscoelastic constitutive mode in the NMM,crack initiation and propagation criteria,and crack identification and evolution techniques,the effects of the loading rates on the cracking.
