## Monazite trumps zircon: applying SHRIMP U Pb geochronology.
Although zircon is the most widely used geochronometer to determine the crystallisation ages of granites,it can be unreliable for low temperature melts because they may not crystallise new zircon.For leucocratic granites U Pb zircon dates,therefore,may reflect the ages of the source rocks rather than the igneous crystallisation age.In the Proterozoic Capricorn Orogen of Western.Rock of Ages: The story of British graniteThe introduction of steam ships stimulated the Cornish granite industry from about 1840,with large quantities used to build docks throughout southern England,and from this time these granites were used extensively in London for numerous monuments,buildings and many of the 19th century commercial dock schemes and bridges.Nanhoron granite.

## Granite Wikipedia
Granite ( ˈ ɡ r æ n ɪ t ) is a common type of felsic intrusive igneous rock that is granular and phaneritic in texture.Granites can be predominantly white,pink,or gray in color,depending on their mineralogy.The word "granite" comes from the Latin granum,a grain,in reference to the coarse grained structure of such a holocrystalline rock.Strictly speaking,granite is an igneous rock.Cornubian batholith WikipediaThe Cornubian batholith is a large mass of granite rock,formed about 280 million years ago,which lies beneath much of the south western peninsula of Great Britain.The main exposed masses of granite are seen at Dartmoor,Bodmin Moor,St Austell,Carnmenellis,Land's End and the Isles of Scilly.The intrusion is associated with significant quantities of minerals particularly cassiterite,an ore.
