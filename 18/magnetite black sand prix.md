## How to collect black sand with a magnet The Kid Should.
If you're ever at a beach with some black sand in the mix,run a magnet through the sand to see if the black sand sticks.Exploratorium educator Ken Finn demonstrates this experiment with a magnet and a plastic cup at San Francisco's Ocean Beach.It's how he collects grains of iron oxide and magnetite for an Exploratorium exhibit about magnetism and the magnetic lines of force.Black Sands Processing & Content AssayingHematite and Magnetite are separate Iron Oxide minerals both black in color with only a possibility of a few Gold atoms incorporated into the minerals.As was mentioned previously,there is also a separate black mineral,Manganese Dioxide,(MnO2) which might coat an occasional Gold particle.
