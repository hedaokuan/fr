## Cut To Length (Temper Mill & Leveling) Integrity.
The science behind the temper mill involves compression,or rolling,the stainless through what is known as a cold reducing process,temper pass.This increases the density of the steel by reducing its overall thickness by around 1.5% to 2%,consequently,not allowing the steel to expand under pressure.Pass Design.Bar,Structural & Shape Rolling Finishing.Quad uses a scientific approach that includes developing a family tree that optimizes mill operation,reduces change time and minimizes roll inventory requirements.Simulation programs ensure the pass design will work within the limitations of the existing mill layout,mill stand & motor capabilities.

## Surface and Inner Deformation during Shape Rolling of.
geometries,like square,diamond,round,oval,box etc.Roll pass design,which decides the shape,size and combination of the grooves,is a complex work.However,using an optimal roll pass design will result in defect free products with correct dimension.In the work of improving the roll pass design finite element simulations are a useful tool.blooming mill roll pass designAbstract.The deformation behaviour of a hot rolled microalloyed steel bar of grade 38MnVS6 was examined using an FEM model during the initial passes in a blooming mill,as a function of three different pass schedules,roll groove depth,collar taper angle and corner radius.Get price
