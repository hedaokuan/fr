## Plume (fluid dynamics) Wikipedia
In hydrodynamics,a plume or a column is a vertical body of one fluid moving through another.Several effects control the motion of the fluid,including momentum (inertia),diffusion and buoyancy (density differences).Pure jets and pure plumes define flows that are driven entirely by momentum and buoyancy effects,respectively.Flows between these two limits are usually described as forced.plumepoetry Online Poetry Magazine"PLUME POETRY 7 offers a counter voice to the dominant discourses of our age,a blessed alternative to broadcasts,and information,and 'intelligence.'

(When this pattern remains on a vertical surface after a fire,investigators often describe it as a V pattern.) If doors or windows are opened,or a smoke management system operates,the path of the plume may vary dramatically.Likewise,if the fuel array within the space is irregular,the plume.Atmospheric dispersion modeling WikipediaBriggs plume rise equations.The Gaussian air pollutant dispersion equation (discussed above) requires the input of H which is the pollutant plume's centerline height above ground level—and H is the sum of H s (the actual physical height of the pollutant plume's emission source point) plus ΔH (the plume rise due the plume's buoyancy).

## What Does "Plumb" Mean in Construction?
In construction,a framing member or wall installed so it is perfectly vertical,or plumb,will transfer its supporting load directly downward (compression stress),giving it maximum load bearing capacity.By contrast,if vertical elements are not installed exactly plumb,some of the weight is off center and can apply considerable additional stress (shear load) to the member.LOGIC FLUE & ACCESSORIES GUIDE.
