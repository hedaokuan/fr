## Stirred Milling VERTIMILL® Grinding Mills & Stirred Media.
Stirred Mills have been proven to provide energy savings compared with traditional ball mills.The finer the product required,the more efficient stirred mills will be than a ball mill.The attrition grinding action,vertical arrangement,and the finer media size distribution contribute to make stirred mills more energy efficient grinding machines.Measuring ball mill ventilation GCP Applied TechnologiesThe value of airflow in m 3 hr can be back calculated using the mill diameter and media fill level to a velocity over the mill internals.However,the disadvantage of this method is that it also includes any false air that enters the mill system after the mill exit,through the mill seals,leaking sample points,air slides and the bag filter.

## Ball Mills an overview ScienceDirect Topics
The ball mill is a tumbling mill that uses steel balls as the grinding media.The length of the cylindrical shell is usually 1 1.5 times the shell diameter (Figure 8.11).The feed can be dry,with less than 3% moisture to minimize ball coating,or slurry containing 20 40% water by weight.Classification liner for the second chamber of the ball.The second chamber of a ball mill is mainly for fine grinding.Therefore,using small balls was known to be more efficient as this increases the surface area of media and improves the grinding effect.For the conventional mill using a liner with lifter,however,it was difficult to reduce the ball diameter drastically because the grinding efficiency is extremely lowered by reverse.
